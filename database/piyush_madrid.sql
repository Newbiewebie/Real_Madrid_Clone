Madrid won 11-1, and an eternal rivalry was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the 15th&nbsp;of December 1943,&nbsp;<strong>Santiago Bernab&eacute;u</strong>&nbsp;became the club&#39;s president. It was the start of the legendary mandate in which the club pulled off some great deeds. He took charge intent on building bridges between all the clubs. In 1948 he was named president of honour and merit of the Whites &ldquo;for his extraordinary work and continuing concern for the well-being of the Sociedad Real Madrid Club de F&uacute;tbol&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Madrid faced Valencia in the final (June 9th&nbsp;1946), ten years after the team had won its previous Copa de Espa&ntilde;a. In the Montju&iuml;c stadium the Whites dominated the game, beating Valencia 3-1, to win the cup once more. The mayor of Madrid presented&nbsp;<strong>Ipi&ntilde;a</strong>&nbsp;with the Sports Medal of the City for his part in 237 official matches. Each player received a leather purse with a one thousand peseta (6&euro;) note.</p>\r\n', '666ad0e1b6bfcf_copa_general.png', 1, '2024-06-13 10:58:41'),

The seeds of Madrid&#39;s reputation as winners had been sown, but the outbreak of the Civil War was to cut their run short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Madrid had now accepted the fact that the success they craved would only be possible with the best players. With Zamora, Ciriaco, Quincoces, among others, the trophies came quickly. The 1931-1932 season was a great one for Lippo Hertza&#39;s team. The Whites finished the league as unbeaten champions. It was the start of an era of Madrid dominance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a month after the latest cup win (1936), civil war broke out. Real Madrid&#39;s finest hour on the pitch so far, was under threat and cut short by the military conflict. It led to many players ending their careers or leaving the country in exile.

The latter hosted the first match in the recently created Campeonato de Liga (1928).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What began as a project between football fans at the start of the century was starting to take on unimaginable proportions. The silver medal won by the national side in the Olympic Games in Antwerp (1920) further bolstered its following. The outlook for our club was looking optimistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Campeonato de Liga was born out of these circumstances and the enormous organisational problems in Spanish football were a thing of the past. The parties involved agreed that there should be three&nbsp;<em>divisiones</em>. The six champions of Spain, the three runners-up and the winner of a promotional tournament between the clubs in the&nbsp;<em>Segunda</em>&nbsp;would play in the&nbsp;<em>Primera</em>.

Each company was looking out for its own interests, and while some supported the Federaci&oacute;n, others formed another organisation in parallel, the Uni&oacute;n de Clubes.

It was he who, in 1900, called a general meeting to decide which players would form Madrid&#39;s first team. The Padr&oacute;s brothers took the reins shortly afterwards. Football was starting to generate a lot of attention and the number of members was growing in leaps and bounds.
